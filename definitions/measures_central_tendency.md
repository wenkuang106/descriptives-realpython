## Mean
The sample mean, also called the sample arithmetic mean or simply the average, is the arithmetic average of all the items in a dataset. The mean of a dataset 𝑥 is mathematically expressed as Σᵢ𝑥ᵢ/𝑛, where 𝑖 = 1, 2, …, 𝑛. In other words, it’s the sum of all the elements 𝑥ᵢ divided by the number of items in the dataset 𝑥.

## Weighted Mean 
The weighted mean, also called the weighted arithmetic mean or weighted average, is a generalization of the arithmetic mean that enables you to define the relative contribution of each data point to the result.

## Harmonic Mean 
The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the mean of the reciprocals of all items in the dataset: 𝑛 / Σᵢ(1/𝑥ᵢ), where 𝑖 = 1, 2, …, 𝑛 and 𝑛 is the number of items in the dataset 𝑥. 

## Geometric Mean 
The geometric mean is the 𝑛-th root of the product of all 𝑛 elements 𝑥ᵢ in a dataset 𝑥: ⁿ√(Πᵢ𝑥ᵢ), where 𝑖 = 1, 2, …, 𝑛.  

## Median 
The sample median is the middle element of a sorted dataset. The dataset can be sorted in increasing or decreasing order. If the number of elements 𝑛 of the dataset is odd, then the median is the value at the middle position: 0.5(𝑛 + 1). If 𝑛 is even, then the median is the arithmetic mean of the two values in the middle, that is, the items at the positions 0.5𝑛 and 0.5𝑛 + 1.

## Mode 
The sample mode is the value in the dataset that occurs most frequently. If there isn’t a single such value, then the set is multimodal since it has multiple modal values. For example, in the set that contains the points 2, 3, 2, 8, and 12, the number 2 is the mode because it occurs twice, unlike the other items that occur only once.
