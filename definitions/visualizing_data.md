## box plots 
The box plot is an excellent tool to visually represent descriptive statistics of a given dataset. It can show the range, interquartile range, median, mode, outliers, and all quartiles. 

## histogram 
Histograms are particularly useful when there are a large number of unique values in a dataset. The histogram divides the values from a sorted dataset into intervals, also called bins. Often, all bins are of equal width, though this doesn’t have to be the case. The values of the lower and upper bounds of a bin are called the bin edges.

The frequency is a single value that corresponds to each bin. It’s the number of elements of the dataset with the values between the edges of the bin. By convention, all bins but the rightmost one are half-open. They include the values equal to the lower bounds, but exclude the values equal to the upper bounds. The rightmost bin is closed because it includes both bounds. If you divide a dataset with the bin edges 0, 5, 10, and 15, then there are three bins:
```sh 
The first and leftmost bin contains the values greater than or equal to 0 and less than 5.
```
```sh
The second bin contains the values greater than or equal to 5 and less than 10.
```
```sh
The third and rightmost bin contains the values greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 15.
```

## pie charts
Pie charts represent data with a small number of labels and given relative frequencies. They work well even with the labels that can’t be ordered (like nominal data). A pie chart is a circle divided into multiple slices. Each slice corresponds to a single distinct label from the dataset and has an area proportional to the relative frequency associated with that label.

## bar charts 
Bar charts also illustrate data that correspond to given labels or discrete numeric values. They can show the pairs of data from two datasets. Items of one set are the labels, while the corresponding items of the other are their frequencies. Optionally, they can show the errors related to the frequencies, as well.

## xy plots 
The x-y plot or scatter plot represents the pairs of data from two datasets. The horizontal x-axis shows the values from the set x, while the vertical y-axis shows the corresponding values from the set y. You can optionally include the regression line and the correlation coefficient.

## heatmap 
A heatmap can be used to visually show a matrix. The colors represent the numbers or elements of the matrix. Heatmaps are particularly useful for illustrating the covariance and correlation matrices.
