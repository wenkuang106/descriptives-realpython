## Variance 
The sample variance quantifies the spread of the data. It shows numerically how far the data points are from the mean. You can express the sample variance of the dataset 𝑥 with 𝑛 elements mathematically as 𝑠² = Σᵢ(𝑥ᵢ − mean(𝑥))² / (𝑛 − 1), where 𝑖 = 1, 2, …, 𝑛 and mean(𝑥) is the sample mean of 𝑥.

## standard deviatio n
The sample standard deviation is another measure of data spread. It’s connected to the sample variance, as standard deviation, 𝑠, is the positive square root of the sample variance. The standard deviation is often more convenient than the variance because it has the same unit as the data points.

## skewerness 
The sample skewness measures the asymmetry of a data sample.

## percentiles 
The sample 𝑝 percentile is the element in the dataset such that 𝑝% of the elements in the dataset are less than or equal to that value. Also, (100 − 𝑝)% of the elements are greater than or equal to that value. If there are two such elements in the dataset, then the sample 𝑝 percentile is their arithmetic mean. Each dataset has three quartiles, which are the percentiles that divide the dataset into four parts:
```sh 
The first quartile is the sample 25th percentile. It divides roughly 25% of the smallest items from the rest of the dataset.
```
```sh
The second quartile is the sample 50th percentile or the median. Approximately 25% of the items lie between the first and second quartiles and another 25% between the second and third quartiles.
```
```sh
The third quartile is the sample 75th percentile. It divides roughly 25% of the largest items from the rest of the dataset.
```

## range 
The range of data is the difference between the maximum and minimum element in the dataset.
